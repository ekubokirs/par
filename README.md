ParDIY
===

Theresa and Emilia are refactoring ParDIY to have a different backend which will be better suited to what they would like ParDIY to be built out to be.

ParDIY is a social community which brings together the people who like to create their own parties, including the food, decorations, etc.  Each user can create party templates and save them for others to use as well as being able to save parties from others.

Currently, party ideas and projects can be found as separate pins on Pinterest or as individual blog posts but we would like to combine this to be more effective and easier to use.
